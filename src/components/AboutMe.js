      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I recently completed my Associate of Science in Software and Database Development and am now pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at Western Governors University, with a focus on C#. I have substantial experience with Java, having developed an Android app for my A.S. capstone course. This app utilized APIs from YouTube, Google, Firebase, and GitHub to create a user-driven, mood-based song suggestion platform aimed at providing better song recommendations based on real user feedback. The goal was to aid people in processing their emotions through music therapy.

        My curiosity spans a broad range of subjects, including history, geology, astronomical sciences, art, psychology, technology, and mechanical engineering. I enjoy learning, sharing knowledge, and analyzing information to create a comprehensive understanding of various topics. Additionally, I've explored machine learning using Python, developing simple programs for analyzing stock and crypto prices, identifying patterns, and making predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about finding a role that combines my diverse skills and interests to make a positive impact and help others.
